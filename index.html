    <h3>Who are we</h3>
      <p>The advanced heart failure unit is a mixed IMC/LCC unit. That just means that we are able to take patients who are normally med-surg, intermediate care, or, occasionally, low critical care. We have a few specialties on our unit. These are pulmonary hypertension, heart transplants, and LVAD patients. We accept other patients, but these are our priority patients as they cannot receive the care that we offer on other units.</p>
      <p>Because most of our patient population is in heart failure, there are some patterns that you will begin to see over time. We place a large focus on education for our patients about their diets. Most of us should avoid getting too much salt in our diets and even more so for our heart failure patients as it can cause them to retain excess fluid in their bodies. Hand in hand with this are fluid restrictions that many of our patients should abide by to, again, mitigate fluid retention. Remember to check on your patients intake and output every shift and to document everything so that everyone is on the same page with fluids!</p>

    <h3>Primary duties</h3>
      <p>As a care partner, our duties are pretty straightforward. Time will likely be the biggest issue to manage, but we work as a team and you can always feel free to ask a coworker if they can help you if you get behind.</p>
      <ul> 
        <li>Vital Signs
          <p>Vital signs are done on our unit at least q4h at 0800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 0000, and 0400.</p>
          <p>If our patients are in need of glucose checks, these are typically done at 0800, 1200, 1600, and 2000. Occasionally, if a patient receives tube feeds, they may be done q6h at 0600, 1200, 1800, and 0000.</p>
          <p>VS ranges
            <ul>
              <li>Temperature - report to RN if over 100.4, but if you are noticing an upward trend (ie. 97.4 => 98.4 => 99.5), go ahead and let the primary RN know so they can be proactive in their care.</li>
              <li>Pulse - report if the patient drops below 60 and this is not their baseline or over 100 and not baseline. For some of our patients, a heart rate of 50 or 110 might be normal, but you can't know without checking the trends in their data.</li>
              <li>Respirations - report to your RN if the respirations are under 12 or over 24. There is some room for error here, but take note of their trends. if they normally have a RR of 12 and suddenly they are at 22, you should have a questioning attitude and investigate why they are suddenly having more trouble breathing.</li>
              <li>Blood Pressure - report systolics outside of 100-140 and diastolics outside of 60-80, but remember to check your trends. For some of our patients, having a pressure in the low 90s/50s is baseline.</li>
              <li>Oxygen Saturation - report O2 saturation lower than 93% or 88% for patients with COPD.</li>
              <li>Blood Glucose - report anything out of the range of 90-149. any lower and the RN will likely want the patient to get some carbs before they drop any lower and higher will likely mean the patient will be getting a dose of insulin.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>Activities of Daily Living
          <p>Some of our patients are completely independent and won't need much assistance with their ADLs aside from some supplies like soap or a new gown. However the majority of our patients need some level of assistance getting their daily routine done. If they need help getting washed up, getting to the restroom, eating their food, etc., that falls on us. Encourage them to assist in whatever ways they can and help them with the rest. For most of our patients, they will be hoping to go home and be independent again and so the exercise of doing their ADLs will help them reach their goal.</p>

            <li>Wipe clean glucometer</li>
          </ol>

            <li>Check EKG looks legible and 'Print', 'Save', and 'Transfer' it. This prints a hard copy to go in their physical chart and uploads it to their EPIC chart.</li>
            <li>Turn off machine and wipe clean. Remove stickers from patient.</li>
