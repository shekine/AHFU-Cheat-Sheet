Advanced Heart Failure care partner and new hire cheat sheet

As a nursing care partner with the Advanced Heart Failure Unit and given the high turnover rates surrounding the pandemic, I felt there was an impending knowledge gap with onboarding new hires. Many of our experienced preceptors have moved on to other roles or faced unforeseen difficulties that have forced them to be away from work. I have tried to condense some of the most frequently asked questions new hire care partners and nurses ask me and provide it in an easy to access format.

I created a Codepen with this info in some of my free time using Pug. Because I don't have access to some of the same programs on our work computers, I created a replit and cloned it to a Github repository. 

It is served over Github Pages at this URL:
